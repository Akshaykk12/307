/*[7]. Department of Computer Engineering has student's club named 'Pinnacle Club'. Students of second,
       third and final year of department can be granted membership on request. Similarly one may cancel
       the membership of club. First node is reserved for president of club and last node is reserved for
       secretary of club. Write C++ program to maintain club memberâ€˜s information using singly linked list.
       Store student PRN and Name. Write functions to:
       a) Add and delete the members as well as president or even secretary.
       b) Compute total number of members of club
       c) Display members
       d) Two linked lists exists for two divisions. Concatenate two lists.

Linked List : A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes .
              Here , each node stores the data and the address of the next node .
              HEAD: address of 1st node
              NULL: Next portion of last node
TYPES : singly , doubly , circular

## Doubly Circular linked list : Two consecutive elements are linked or connected by previous and next pointer and
                                 last node points to first node by next pointer and the first node also points
                                 to the last node by previous pointer
